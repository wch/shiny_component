# Cards and filling behavior

All the card examples in this page have the same height as imposed by their containing element.

## Simple

Just a card with a title and a plot. The plot will stretch to fill remaining space.

```
card(
  h3("Foo"),
  plot()
)
```

<Story of={CardStories.basic} />

## Sized plot

When the plot is given a height value, then it will always stick to that height even if it doesn't fill the card.

```
card(
  h3("Bar"),
  plot(height=300)
)
```

<Story of={CardStories.fixedHeightPlot} />

## Turning off flex behavior

When `no_flex` is set to `True`, then elements that would normally flex, will go to their default size (if none is specified).

```
card(
  no_flex=True,
  header("I am a header"),
  plot(),
  footer("I am a footer"),
)
```

<Story of={CardStories.noFlex} />

## Overflowing content

When a card is filled with more content than there is space, it will scroll. If a header and footer are added, they will remain fixed in place.

```
card(
  header("I am a header"),
  plot(height=250),
  p(...),
  plot(height=350),
  footer("I am a footer"),
)
```

<Story of={CardStories.overflowingContent} />
